## Work Experience
**Senior Associate @ PwC (_April 2024 - Present_)**
- Implemented sales analysis to identify top-selling fabric products and their specifications for specific regions or time periods.
  The system displays tabular results and generates images of the top-selling products using Stable Diffusion.
- Fine-tuned the Stable Diffusion model in AWS SageMaker to generate fabric images based on client input images.
  Utilized upscaling techniques to enhance image quality.

**Associate @ PwC (_August 2023 - March 2024_)**
- Performed product classification using a basic decision tree model for interpretability.
  Applied the classification logic to generative AI to demonstrate the underlying logic behind the classification.
  Established correlation between input features and output class using Cramér's V statistical model.
- Developed a system to convert natural language prompts into SQL queries for database querying.
  Implemented chain of thought reasoning to determine if a prescriptive answer or a simple query was required, and executed actions through agents.
  Included plotting capabilities upon user request.

**Data Science Intern @ Amazon (_January 2023 - June 2023_)**
- Implemented a bidirectional LSTM model for the text classification task of identifying product listings as bundles or not, deploying and running the model in AWS SageMaker
- Study on Quantitative Regression to quantify the range within which product prices should ideally fall, thereby reducing the offers which are Too Good to be True and might be detrimental to the customers

**Machine Learning Intern @ Expedia (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Conducted NDCG metric evaluation for Learn To Rank model using PySpark on IntelliJ IDE, AWS storage, and Databricks cloud analytics platform
- Improving the logic of benchmark and improving NDCG score computation using segmentation approach

**Associate @ PwC (_July 2018 - September 2021_)**
- Exploratory Data Analysis, modifying SQL Stored Procedures, Functions and Triggers.
- Written SQL queries for validating the data against different kinds of reports in Power BI and Tableau.
- Implemented data migration using SAP BODS to transition SAP data from legacy systems to target environments
  
## Projects
### Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion Model for Fabric Image Generation
Leveraged AWS SageMaker to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model for generating high-quality fabric images based on client inputs, using advanced upscaling techniques to enhance image resolution.

### Sales Analysis and Visualization
Conducted comprehensive sales analysis to identify top-selling fabric products and their specifications by region or time period. Developed a system that provides tabular results and generates images of the top products using Stable Diffusion.

### Product Classification with Decision Trees and Generative AI
Implemented a basic decision tree model for product classification, focusing on interpretability. Used generative AI to demonstrate the underlying logic and established feature-output correlations with Cramér's V statistical method.

### Natural Language to SQL Query Translation and Automated Reasoning
Developed a sophisticated system to translate natural language prompts into SQL queries for database access. Implemented a chain of thought process to determine the need for prescriptive answers versus simple queries, with integrated data visualization upon user request.

### Advanced Model Implementation and Evaluation
Conducted NDCG metric evaluation for Learn To Rank models using PySpark on IntelliJ IDE, AWS storage, and Databricks. Improved benchmark logic and NDCG score computation through segmentation techniques.

### Bidirectional LSTM for Text Classification
Deployed a bidirectional LSTM model in AWS SageMaker for the text classification task of identifying product listings as bundles. 

### Quantative Regression on Product Prices
Conducted quantitative regression analysis to define optimal product price ranges, mitigating potentially harmful "Too Good to Be True" offers.
